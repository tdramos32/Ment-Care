## PRODUCT FEATURES OVERVIEW

### Satisfactory:
- [X] The Feature section contains sufficient documentation for a user to interact with your updated version of PRODUCT.
- [X] documentation covers all steps that the user would need to take to exercise all of your user stories.
- [X] Screenshots are included that capture the key interactions between a user and your new product.
- [X] Course staff were able to follow these instructions to successfully interact with your project implementation.
- [X] The section is at most 4 pages (roughly 2,000 words maximum), NOT including figures. Fewer pages are absolutely acceptable, consider this a rough limit

## TECHNICAL OVERVIEW
### Satisfactory:

- [X] Technical Overview contains a description of any substantive changes to the existing codebase, and of the architecture of your new code.
- [X] It uses UML diagrams, CRC cards, state diagrams or any of the other techniques that help describe the structure.
- [X] It provides a well-reasoned rationale for why this is the “right” design.
- [X] The document is at most 2 pages (fewer pages are absolutely acceptable, consider this a rough limit)

#### Our project was heavily inspired by ![Jawwad-Fida's](https://github.com/Jawwad-Fida/HealthStack-System) team
- Their original implementation had only two users in mind, both the doctors patients. Their application also had no interest on who it is that was using their
system as it only targeted boh patients and doctor. In their design, only patients can make appointments for themselves and only the doctors are capable of approving or
rejecting the appointment request. So their system was based on a one-to-one system where patients and doctors are fully in control of the system.
- Our design uses a different structure where both doctors & patients do not need to communicate with one another through a server. Everything is done through a middleman, in this case which is
the Health Staff. Here is an example below.

## PROCESS OVERVIEW
### Satisfactory

- [X] Process overview contains a detailed description of the manner in which agile project management processes were used during the project (i.e., sprints, sprint reviews, retrospectives and blameless reviews).
- [X] It provides a summary of what was planned to happen in each sprint vs what actually happened, with a discussion of what was revised as a result.
- [X] The document is at most 2 pages (fewer pages are absolutely acceptable, consider this a rough limit)
